Your friend Rahul in an attempt to dual boot his system, crashed his hard disk containing his private key.

Rahul asked you a favour to find his private key in return for the flag you are looking for which he locked in a safe.
To extract information from the safe the following protocol must be followed:
    1) A request for the information must be sent along with the user id within the specified format.
    2) After the request is accepted, to get the flag the user id must be sent within the specified format.

At the present moment, Rahul just has the request to be sent encrypted within the specified format. Can you help him find his private key?
