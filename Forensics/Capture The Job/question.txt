Well, your internship as sysadmin here at SuperSecure company has been going good so far, well except for your err.. questionable knowledge of tar commands but that's cool for now.
Since we had to let go of our sysadmin due to 'trust issues', we're ready to offer you a job here after you complete your final internship task.
We have captured some seemingly suspicious network traffic from some of our employees.
Can you find out if they've been doing anything malicious and get yourself a job here?

Flag format:
Your flag is p_ctf{part1_part2_part3} where:
part1 : MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique ID of the exploit/attack being performed in 1.pcap. Eg: part1 = T1000.001
part2 : Name of the specific exploit/attack (not the category, be specific) being performed in 2.pcap, lowercase, no spaces or special chars. Eg: If it is Abc's Ef-gh exploit, part2 = abcsefgh
part3 : Information that can be found in the packets of 3.pcap, you'll know it when you see it.
