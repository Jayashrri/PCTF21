Just few days after hiring the new employee Mark, some confidential information about the company has been leaked out despite the company's odd way of protecting their important documents.
On enquiring the suspect Mark, he pinpoints his finger towards the company sysadmin, who he said seemed 'fishy' while setting up his new computer.
Can you figure out if anything has been leaked from Mark's system? If so what was it?
You have been given a memory dump of his computer taken just after installation and an apparently crucial document from his computer as well.
