Flat-earthers have finally found a flat planet and made an alliance with the corkamis (native alien race).
Earth is under imminent attack and the only way to stop it is to nuke their mothership.
Alice and Bob (you) are stationed at a missile launch facility on Earth.
Alice's task is to launch the nukes but she needs the launch codes first. Help her find them.

You and Alice will use a quantum communication channel using BB84 protocol.
If you need some time to get the hang of this quantum thing, you are allowed to switch to a classical channel.
Just send a 'SWITCH' to switch between quantum and classical channels. (only one switch is allowed)
