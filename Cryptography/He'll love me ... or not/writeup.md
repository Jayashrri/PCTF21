We have been given:
* M - order of the finite field
* G - Generator point
* P - Point obtained on multiplying G with a scalar

Our objective is to find out the scalar.

To define an elliptic curve we need at least three parameters - M,a,b

After connecting we get a series of question asking us to determine
if the given number is prime or not.

Notice that there are always a fixed number of such questions where
each answer is either YES or NO.

If we consider this as a binary sequence with YES = 0 & NO = 1 and
convert the sequence to a string, we get "Here you go, a = 2" which
is the first parameter of the elliptic curve.

Using M,a,G we can find out b also, through this equation:
```
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b mod M
b = y^2 - x^3 - ax mod M
```
This gives b = 3.

(Use sage since its very easy to do mathematical stuff there)

Notice that the order of the point G is composite and can be factorized
into small factors.

```python
E = EllipticCurve(M, [a, b])
G = (179210853392303317793440285562762725654, 105268671499942631758568591033409611165)
G = E.point(G)
factors = [x[0]**x[1] for x in factor(G.order())]
```

Therefore we use Pohlig-Hellman attack to solve the ECDLP and finally use CRT to
get the solution.

```python
E = EllipticCurve(M, [a, b])
G = (179210853392303317793440285562762725654, 105268671499942631758568591033409611165)
P = (280810182131414898730378982766101210916, 291506490768054478159835604632710368904)

G = E.point(G)
P = E.point(P)
factors = [x[0]**x[1] for x in factor(G.order())]

disc_logs = []

for x in factors:
	y = G.order()//x
	disc_logs.append(discrete_logs(y*Q, y*P, operation='+'))

scalar = crt(disc_logs, factors)
scalar = hex(scalar)[2:]
#23fcf62e4ca5319696cfcae39d75860c
```

But now the server refuses to give the flag with a message and the link to a password protected archive.
Note that the message is 16 bytes long and the scalar is of 16 bytes.
A possible solution might be to XOR the message and the scalar together and submit the resulting hex value as password.
Luckily this works and we get the flag.

```python
def xor(p, q):
	assert len(p) == len(q)
	return bytes([p[i]^q[i] for i in range(len(p))])

message = "LOL did you seriously think we would give up the flag that easy?"
message = message.encode()
message = [message[i: i+16] for i in range(0, len(message), 16)]
scalar = bytes.fromhex("23fcf62e4ca5319696cfcae39d75860c")

passwd = ''
for i in range(len(message)):
	passwd += xor(scalar, message[i]).hex()

print(passwd)
#6fb3ba0e28cc55b6efa0bfc3ee10f4654c898542358545feffa1a1c3ea10a67b4c899a4a6cc258e0f3efbf93bd01ee69039a9a4f2b8545fef7bbea86fc06ff33
```

The flag is "pctf{#311b0y_#311m@n_w#@75_753_d!ff3r3nc3_?}".
